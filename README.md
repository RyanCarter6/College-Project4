# College-Project4

This is a project I did early on in my college courses. 

It's basically just a way to cacluate a deposit with and without interest. Users can use a menu to input their desired numbers and can see the results after the calculations are made.

Looking back, I am pretty happy with this project. It can efficiently perform calculations, has adequate comments, and has separate files for performing different functionality.
